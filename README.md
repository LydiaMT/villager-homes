# Villager Homes

### Problem Domain

The Animal Crossing fandom is huge! While there are plenty of public resources available to players across the world wide web, it can be difficult to find information on villager home exteriors. Many ACNH players enjoy picking themes for their islands. Villager homes have a wide variety of aesthetics from color, to material, to architecture. These styles can be key to bringing your island theme to life!

My goal with this website is to provide an intuitive user experience where users can narrow down villagers' homes by desired features through filtered form dropdowns. 

### User Stories

*As a user, I want to be able to pick villagers for my island by their home exteriors so the houses match the theme or aesthetic of my island.*
